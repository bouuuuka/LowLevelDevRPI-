# Linux Kernel Mimic for RPi 3 

## Overview

This project mimics the Linux kernel's basic functionalities on a Raspberry Pi 3 (RPi 3), specifically processor initialization, interrupt handling, and task scheduling. The system is built using a combination of assembly, C, and a Makefile to facilitate the development process.

### Features:
- **Processor Initialization:** Sets up the ARM processor for basic operation on the RPi 3.
- **Interrupt Handling:** Implements basic interrupt handling for hardware events.
- **Task Scheduling:** Implements a simple task scheduler.

### Hardware Used:
- **Raspberry Pi 3 (RPi 3):** The ARM-based processor running the system.
- **UART to USB Converter:** Used for serial communication between the RPi 3 and an external computer.

### Technologies:
- **Assembly Language:** For low-level processor initialization and interrupt handling.
- **C Programming Language:** For higher-level control, including scheduling and task management.
- **Makefile:** To compile and build the project.
